                    <span class="lead">Nana</span> follows the life of two girls, both with the name of Nana. They meet on a train and compliment each others styles despite them being complete <span class="fw-bold fst-italic">opposites</span>. They continue their lives together in a shared apartment, having the best time with each other and having a <span class="text-decoration-underline">closer bond</span> over any lover. As the story develops, Nana Osaki and Nana Komatsu have problems, often about paying rent and getting money. The series, being unfinished, will never give fans closure after the unfortuante event that will unfold later into the story.
